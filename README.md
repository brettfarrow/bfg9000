# bfg9000 - Bingo File Generator 9000

What do I know about a bingo card creator? It is going to be a 5x5 grid with a center space that optionally is a free space. That should definitely be a configuration option somewhere in the application.

Since I am specifying that this is a bingo file generator, I want to be able to take the web page and then print it either from an actual printer or via a saved to PDF. You never know whether this is going to be shared across a website or actually printed out. Most likely neither, but you never know.

Oh yes, I should make this explicit that I need to be able to control the number of bingo cards that should be generated.This should be a toggle or slider that the user controls.

I need a text area that will let me paste in a number of lines with line breaks, differentiating each square's text in order to make it easier to copy and paste bingo card information.
